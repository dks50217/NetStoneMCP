# NetStone.MCP

🧩 MCP Toolset for FFXIV Lodestone — Integrates [NetStone](https://github.com/xivapi/NetStone) into a natural-language-capable MCP server for querying character and world data from Final Fantasy XIV.

## Overview

This project transforms the powerful, modern `.NET` FFXIV Lodestone API library **NetStone** into a set of Model Context Protocol tools, allowing you to use natural language prompts to query Lodestone data via an MCP-compatible LLM client such as OpenAI or Claude.
